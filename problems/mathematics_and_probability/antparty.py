# What is the probability that two ants collide when from one verex to another in
# an n-gon?
#
# a priori p=1/2 (right or left)
#
# there is only a non-collision if all ants chooses the same direction
# p(collision) = 1 - p(non-collision) = 1-p_left^n-p_right^n = 1-(1/2)^n 
#
# specially for n=3 (i.e triangle) = 1 - 2(1/2)^3 = 1-2/8 = 3/4
